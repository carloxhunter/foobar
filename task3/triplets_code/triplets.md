# Task 3
# Subtask 1

Having a list of numbers as input calculate the numbers of posible combinations of 3 numbers (triplets) Xi, Yj, Zk  which can be created from this list of numbers when i<j<k and Y can be divided with X and Z can be divided with Z.

Memory and speed is important because the input can be as long as 2000 numbers and each number can vary from 1 to 9999, therefore storing combinations is not an option. Dynamic Programming approach is used in this solution.
